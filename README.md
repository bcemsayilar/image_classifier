# Classifier with Torch 

This project is designed to classify images of birds, cats, dogs, and horses using convolutional neural networks (CNNs). It includes data preprocessing, feature extraction, and clustering techniques. The project is useful for data scientists and machine learning engineers looking to implement image classification and clustering models.

## Project Structure

  - `bird_embeddings.csv`
  - `cat_embeddings.csv`
  - `dog_embeddings.csv`
  - `horse_embeddings.csv`

- `processed_images/`: Contains preprocessed images categorized by animals.
  - `bird/`
  - `cat/`
  - `dog/`
  - `horse/`

- `raw_images/`: Contains raw images categorized by animals.
  - `bird/`
  - `cat/`
  - `dog/`
  - `horse/`

- `clustering.py`: Script for clustering images based on their embeddings.
- `data_model.py`: Script for defining the data model and handling data.
- `get_embeddings.py`: Script for generating embeddings from images.
